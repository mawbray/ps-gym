# ps-gym

## Overview
ps-gym is a custom open-ai gym package built specifically for the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to chemical production scheduling problems. Currently, the package only has implementations of single stage, parallel batch production scheduling problems, however, this will be expanded in the future. 

The main idea of ps-gym is the identification of nonlinear transformations of the control space, via logic, in order to reduce the difficulty of the sequential decision making problem. This has been deemed a reasonable approach given the dependence of plant operation on standard operating procedure. 

## Installation 

If downloading the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mawbray/ps-gym.git
cd ps-gym 
pip install -e.
```

Will enable pip install in future
